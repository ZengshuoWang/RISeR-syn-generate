# RISeR-syn-generate
- The purpose of this repository is to generate five different types of realistic synthetic retinal image sequences based on [[RISeR]](https://github.com/ZengshuoWang/RISeR).
- We think that RISeR-syn-generate has significant potential application value in registration method evaluation, deep learning-based model training and data augmentation, etc.
- A more detailed description can be found in our paper, which is coming soon.
- The official implementation code will be made publicly available immediately after the paper is accepted! We believe this day will come soon, so stay tuned!
